# pseudovote

This is to become an educational yet fully functional web service to demonstrate the process conceived at [Uduloor](https://github.com/infoaed/uduloor).

There is a prototype/MVP running on [Pseudovote.net](https://pseudovote.net/) mainly for a [smoke testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing_(software)) from February 17th. There is [a write-up](https://gafgaf.infoaed.ee/en/posts/pseudonymous-voting-in-wikimedia/) explaining the historical context of the project and [slides from a 2020 presentation](https://p6drad-teel.net/~p6der/pseudovote-2020.pdf) for local computer security/hacker crowd explaining the idea/use case and asking comments. The project is currently in a pre [source release](https://github.com/infoaed/pseudovote/milestone/1) status.

Although not published, the code has been in its different forms already used at GAs of [Wikimedia Estonia](https://wikimedia.ee/haaleta-nagu-vikipedist/) and [Estonian Green Party](https://www.facebook.com/rohelised/posts/325701606250799).
